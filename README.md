"Hi There! Welcome to my pet-simulator game. This was dedicated to my freinds cat MIKI. This is for all the people that have lost their cats. Its a pretty simple project. It uses pygame so keep that in mind. The instructions are given in the game and one more thing, the game ends automatically when the timer reaches 0. And petting makes the cat happy (duh). Feel free to mess around with the code and dont forget to have fun! Made with lots of Love by Ahnaf <3 Thanks for supporting a teen programmer like me!
